# Integration Use Case: BillingSDK with DodoPayments

This document provides a brief overview of how to integrate BillingSDK with DodoPayments, as referenced in the assignment example.

## BillingSDK Overview

BillingSDK is a hypothetical billing system that provides components and APIs for managing subscriptions, invoices, and billing-related functionality. It offers a comprehensive set of tools for implementing billing features in your application.

Key features:
- Subscription management
- Invoice generation and tracking
- Pricing plans and tiers
- Customer management
- Reporting and analytics

## DodoPayments Overview

DodoPayments is a hypothetical payment processor that handles the actual payment transactions. It provides APIs for processing credit card payments, bank transfers, and other payment methods.

Key features:
- Payment processing
- Payment method storage
- Refund handling
- Webhook notifications
- Fraud detection

## Integration Approach

When integrating these two systems, BillingSDK acts as the billing component that manages the subscription lifecycle, while DodoPayments handles the actual payment processing.

### Integration Steps

1. **Set up DodoPayments account**
   - Register for API credentials
   - Configure webhook endpoints
   - Set up payment methods

2. **Configure BillingSDK**
   - Set up subscription plans
   - Configure payment provider (DodoPayments)
   - Set up webhook handlers

3. **Implement Payment Flow**
   - BillingSDK initiates payment request
   - DodoPayments processes the payment
   - DodoPayments sends confirmation to BillingSDK via webhook
   - BillingSDK updates subscription status

4. **Handle Events**
   - Payment succeeded/failed events
   - Subscription lifecycle events
   - Refund and dispute events

## Example: Pricing Card Component

A common UI element in this integration would be a pricing card component that displays subscription options and initiates the payment process when selected.

The AI assistant can generate this component based on the API documentation from both systems, incorporating:

- Pricing information from BillingSDK
- Payment processing from DodoPayments
- Proper error handling and status updates

## Testing the Integration

To test this integration:
1. Create test accounts on both platforms
2. Use sandbox/test mode for payments
3. Verify webhook communication
4. Test various payment scenarios (success, failure, refund)
